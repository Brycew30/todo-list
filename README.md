# ToDo List

ToDo List gives users a clean, central location for keeping up with their many tasks. With the ability to create a new list, search for lists based on items, or scrolling through the existing lists, users should never have to worry about forgetting to do something again!

## Getting Started
To use ToDo List, clone this reop and install the required gems:
```
bundle install
```
Next, migrate the database:
```
rake db:migrate
```
Then, seed the database:
```
rake db:seed
```
Start the rails server:
```
rails s
```
In a new terminal window, start a new server (for example):
```
npx reload -b
```
Start making and reading the lists!
